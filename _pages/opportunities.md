Science is most successful when ideas and knowledge from a variety of perspectives and experiences are openly and respectfully exchanged. Together, our team works to cultivate a safe environment where everyone is treated with respect regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender identification, sexual orientation, age, disability status, or economic background. Members of under-represented groups are especially encouraged to contact us about opportunities in the lab. Indiana University does not discriminate and is a equal opportunity and affirmative action employer [(see here)](https://policies.iu.edu/policies/ua-01-equal-opportunity-affirmative-action/index.html?_gl=1*fctwqy*_ga*NDQwODg2NjMwLjE3MTUwMDk2Mjk.*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTcxNTExMzA0NS4yLjAuMTcxNTExMzA0Ny41OC4wLjA.).

### Undergraduate Students
Getting hands-on lab experience as an undergraduate is a great way to determine if research is the right path for you. Our lab often has several undergraduate students working with specific graduate students or postdocs on research projects. Students interested in working in the lab should send an email containing research interests and a resume so we can determine if our lab will be a good fit. Undergrads should expect to spend 6-12 hours a week in the lab throughout the semester. Students are encouraged to earn course credit ([X490](https://biology.indiana.edu/student-portal/undergraduate/courses/x490.html)) and consider developing an [Honor's thesis](https://biology.indiana.edu/student-portal/undergraduate/honors-program/thesis.html) based on their research projects.

### Graduate Students
Opportunities are available for motivated graduate students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in microbial ecology and evolution. Prospective students may apply either to the Prospectives may apply either to the [Evolution, Ecology, & Behavior Program (EEB)](https://biology.indiana.edu/graduate/evolution-ecology-behavior/index.html) or the [Microbiology Program](https://biology.indiana.edu/graduate/microbiology/index.html), both of which are in the [Department of Biology](https://biology.indiana.edu/). The application deadline is December 1. Students are funded through research grants, teaching assistantships, and university fellowships. Prospectives should send an overview of their research interests along with a CV.

### Postdocs
Potential postdocs with interests that broadly align with questions being asked in our lab are encouraged to contact us. We often have interdisciplinary grants submitted that would fund postdocs to work on topics related to the ecology and evolutionary biology of microbial systems. We are also open to assisting with the development of independent fellowship applications.
